Turning API Responses into Views with Handlebars
---

## Objectives

1. Explain how to update the DOM based on new data
2. Review writing and using Handlebars templates
3. Use Handlebars to update the DOM

## Introduction

It would be great to frame this lesson with a bit of a metaphor â€” maybe sandwiches, where it's great to _make_ sandwiches (that is, API requests), but we also need to give them to our customers (users)?

That might be a stretch.

## Implementation

Anyway, we should then walk students through manually updating the DOM (which we can expect them to have practice a bit before, just not with an XHR response). Make them feel the pain here so that they can intuitively understand why we might instead want to delegate this sort of thing to handlebars.

Then we can work on rendering a few GitHub responses as templates, say prettifying repo and issue information.
